# Statistics and Social Science Extension for KNIME

This repository contains the code for the Statistics and Social Science Extension for the KNIME Analytics Platform. This extension provides nodes for advanced statistical analysis, time series modeling, and data visualizations, enabling users to perform in-depth explorations of structured data.

The extension is curated and maintained by Francesco Tuscolano (KNIME), Prof. Daniele Tonini, and Pietro Maran (Bocconi University, Milan).

The project's goal is to integrate advanced statistical methodologies within KNIME by leveraging bundled Python packages and transforming them into native KNIME nodes.


## Package Organization


* `knime_extension`: This directory contains the source code for all KNIME Time Series Extension nodes.
* `config.yml`: Example `config.yml` to point to the directory containing the source code of the extension. This directory must also contain `knime.yml` file.
